# Bitburner scripts

## Release lifecycle

Script lifecycle, there is no versioning for the repository:

1. Pre-alpha (development)
2. Alpha (private testing, feature complete)
3. Beta (public testing)
4. Stable

There is too much overhead to keep each "program" versioned in their own repository.

## Methodology

1. One file, one function
2. No imports, duplicate code

## License

Bitburner scripts is released under the [GNU GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) license.
